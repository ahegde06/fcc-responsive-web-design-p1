FreeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Course - Building a Tribute Page

My first HTML/CSS project :)

From the FreeCodeCamp project description:
"Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx."

I included the same content as the example website, but attempted to experiment with some of my own styling.  Consider this an experiment rather than a finished product!
